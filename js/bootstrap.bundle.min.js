The file /soccer-tactics-website/soccer-tactics-website/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js is typically a minified version of the Bootstrap JavaScript library. Since this is a standard library file, I cannot generate its contents directly. You should download the minified version of Bootstrap's JavaScript bundle from the official Bootstrap website or a CDN and place it in the specified directory.

If you need help with any other file or specific content, feel free to ask!
